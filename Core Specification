1. Architectural Overview 
The Meridiem and IoT-craft websites are text-centered websites: the content is authored, edited and rendered in as close to plain 
text as possible. Obviously, any browser can render plaintext. However, all content is uploaded as plain text, with little to no 
markup. The markup is then generated via javascript, html/xml, css3 files that are stored in their respective folders.
