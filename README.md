# Meridiem-IT.com & Iot-Craft.com


This Repository is designed to give open-source access to both my experiements in business processes, as well as 
design choices. In Short: I want other developers to see structure that I put forth into the world. 

The Central premise to the design structure shall be: Economy of Acquisition. THIS repo is for explanation, detail and design. The Websites are for delivering subjmatter as cleanly as possible. 

The sites shall be built by hand. No Wordpress (I know how to set one up), No Joomla (still a work in progress), no content management system. These sites shall be as straightforward as possible. 

All assets outside of Text shall be in service TO Plain Text (perhaps the greatest strcuture Humanity has ever contrived).
